3x4 pixel writing for Gameboy and Pico-8 games or pixel art

I created this font specifically for 3x4 pixel (mostly uppercase) writing in GB Studio for Game Boy games. It also works well for Pico-8, pixel art, and a general retro look. Works well with Aseprite, Libresprite, Photoshop, Photopea, and other apps.

Attribution and donations are highly appreciated.

Just unzip the .ZIP file and double-click to install the .TTF file.
